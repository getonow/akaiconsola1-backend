## üîç Analysis Logic

### Insourcing Analysis
1. Groups parts by part number
2. Compares prices across different suppliers
3. Identifies price differences ‚â•10%
4. Recommends switching to lower-priced suppliers

### Outsourcing Analysis
1. Analyzes parts by commodity type
2. Identifies potential new suppliers based on:
   - Commodity expertise (plastic, metal, gaskets, etc.)
   - Geographic location (European markets)
   - Supplier reputation and capabilities
3. Calculates potential savings based on commodity type
